# theColorless.net Blacklist
## A Google Chrome browser extension

I made this so that each user has a choice whether he wants to see
somebody's posts on the forum. I am against official censorship unless
rules are broken, but on an individual's end, everyone has a choice.

If you are being harassed, if somebody makes you visit the site less
and have less fun, then use this.

It's a simple, yet mighty tool. It can do the site some harm by
disrupting conversations. But: If somebody is worth blending out, then
most likely the conversation would not go well either.

### Installing from source

If you just want to install this and have nothing to do with
programming, then you have to do this:

* Open the extensions page in Chrome
* Check "Developer mode"
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and choose the folder to which you
  downloaded the contents of this repository
* You're done!

### Development

Please fork and play with it. All help is appreciated, and if you have
plausible additions to the code I'll most likely accept your pull
request.
